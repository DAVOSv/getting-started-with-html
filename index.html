<h1> My Notes </h1>
  <b> How the internet works</b>
    <p>The internet is a group of computers that work with each other 
 to transfer information. The world wide web uses HTML to transfer information back and forth. 
 First a computer will link to a web page, that sends an http request to a server ( a computer 
 that hosts the requested information.)
 The server sends the information back to the computer. The information is interpreted through 
 a web browser and displays the information in a visual format.
  </p>

 <b>HTML</b>
  <p>Text content - What you see </p>
  <p>Markup - What it looks like</p>
  <p>References to other documents - Images, videos</p>
  <p>Links to other pages</p><br><br>

  <b> HTML Markup</b>
  <p>A tag is a reference to a purpose made in an html document that tells the website what to do
  with the following information.  </p>
  <p>An element is a line of code with both an opening and closing tag and some content for the tags to act on.</p>
  <br><br>

  <b>Specificity</b>
  <p>Computers need exact instructions to operate as intended. This applies to the internet as well.
    One wrong direction or typo can have major unintended consequences.
  </p>

  <b>HTML Attributes</b>
  <p>Each HTML element is either inline or block. Inline is just for text. Block creatles a box around the element and 
  can work with both text and other kinds of content</p>
